# expo-build-disk-cache

> **Warning**: This plugin requires Expo SDK 53 or higher to work

ðŸš€ Drastically speed up your npx expo run:[android|ios] builds!\
This plugin adds local disk caching for Expo builds.
If a matching cached build exists, it launches instantly, letting you skip the often time-consuming compilation step entirely.
Uses Expo fingerprint (a hash of your native project and dependencies) for intelligent invalidation, building fresh only when needed.

### Getting Started



1. **Install it as a dev dependency**:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev expo-build-disk-cache
   ```

2. **Add it to your app config (still experimental)**:

   ```json
   {
     "experiments": {
       "buildCacheProvider": {
         "plugin": "expo-build-disk-cache"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### Optional Configuration

You can configure the plugin in a few ways:

- **Option A: In App Config**  
  Add the following to your `app.json` or `app.config.js`:
  [HINT:] Keep in mind any change here will result in a different fingerprint -> needs rebuilding

  ```json
  {
    "experiments": {
      "buildCacheProvider": {
        "plugin": "expo-build-disk-cache",
        "options": {
          "cacheDir": "~/.my-cache/",
          "cacheGcTimeDays": 21
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- **Option B: In a Separate Config File**  
  Create a `disk-cache.json` file in your project or home directory. This allows per-machine customization without affecting the fingerprint and can be added to `.gitignore`. The config file merges with the app config and overrides conflicting settings. Also supports the platform specific config folder by using [env-paths](https://github.com/sindresorhus/env-paths?tab=readme-ov-file#pathsconfig).

  ```json
  {
    "cacheDir": "~/.my-cache/",
    "cacheGcTimeDays": 21
  }
  ```

- **Option C: In package.json**  
  ```json
  {
    "disk-cache": {
      "cacheDir": "~/.my-cache/",
      "cacheGcTimeDays": 21
    }
  }
  ```

### Default Configuration

- `cacheDir`: Defaults to a temporary directory in the system's temp folder.
- `cacheGcTimeDays`: Defaults to 7 days; files will be deleted if not used within this period. Set to `-1` to prevent deletion.
- `debug`: Defaults to `false`. Set to `true` for verbose logging
- `enable`: Defaults to `true`. Set to `false` to disable the plugin.

For a complete list of available configuration options, refer to the [source configuration file](src/config/config.ts).

### Using a Cloud-Synced Folder for Cache

To share the build cache across multiple machines, set `cacheDir` to a folder synced with a cloud service (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive). This is beneficial for small teams or individuals who want to speed up their builds without setting up a dedicated server. Larger teams or organizations may want to consider a solution with server for caching.

### Benefits

- **Easy Sharing**: No additional infrastructure is required.
- **Improved Efficiency**: Speeds up builds on all machines.

> **Tip**: Use `cacheGcTimeDays` to control how long files are kept in the cache.
